# Spatial Statistical Analysis with NYC Taxi Trip Data
This project builds upon the study by Xie et al. (2021), “Revealing Spatiotemporal Travel Demand and Community Structure Characteristics with Taxi Trip Data,” and was conducted as part of coursework in GIS and spatial analysis. The goal of this study is to explore the spatiotemporal distribution of travel demand in New York City using taxi trip data and to apply spatial statistical techniques to uncover meaningful urban mobility patterns.

Using New York City taxi trip data from January 2025, the analysis focuses on comparing weekday and weekend travel behavior across major peak hours. Origin–destination (O/D) matrices were constructed for selected time periods, and multiple spatial analytical methods were applied to examine demand concentration, spatial autocorrelation, and local clustering patterns.

## Repository Overview

- Preprocessing scripts for NYC taxi trip data
- Construction of time-specific O/D matrices
- Areal Weighted Interpolation for spatial redistribution
- Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) for demand visualization
- Global and Local Moran’s I (LISA) analysis
- Spatial visualizations
